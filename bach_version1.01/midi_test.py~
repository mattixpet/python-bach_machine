#Import the library

from midiutil.MidiFile import MIDIFile

# Create the MIDIFile Object with 1 track
MyMIDI = MIDIFile(1)

# Tracks are numbered from zero. Times are measured in beats.

track = 0   
time = 0

# Add track name and tempo.
MyMIDI.addTrackName(track,time,"Sample Track")
MyMIDI.addTempo(track,time,120)

# Add a note. addNote expects the following information:
track = 0
channel = 0
pitch = 60
time = 0
duration = 10
volume = 100

# Now add the note.
MyMIDI.addNote(track,channel,pitch,time,duration,volume)
MyMIDI.addNote(track,channel,69,time,duration,volume)
MyMIDI.addNote(track,channel,64,time,duration,volume)

# And write it to disk.
binfile = open("output.mid", 'wb')
MyMIDI.writeFile(binfile)
